# NumericalRelativity

This is my project for the computational physics class at Stanford. It is my
first venture into numerical relativity. I'll first wet my hands by writing
scripts that can compute the curvature and such from the metric. Then using the
geodesic equation, I will compute the orbits of both massive and massless
particles in the Schwarzschild metric. The final part will involve simulating
gravitational waves - but that is only if I can figure all this stuff out!
